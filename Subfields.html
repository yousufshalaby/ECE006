<h1>Subfields of Artificial Intelligence</h1>
<li>Learn the machine</li>
<p>It is a branch of Artificial Intelligence that is concerned with making the computer able to learn on its own from any previous 

experiences or experiences, which makes it able to predict and make the right decision quickly, and this is through the development of algorithms that allow 


this, and it is found that the term was first introduced in 1959 by Arthur Samuel.
</p>

<li>Data mining</li>

<p>It means searching and prospecting for specific data and patterns within a wide range of data through software, as companies can benefit from data mining to improve their performance, increase sales and reduce production costs.
</p>
<li>Retrieval of information and the semantic web</li>
<p>Information retrieval means to search for any kind of data and based, which may be available on the web, through the semantic web concept that transforms data on the world's web into a global database that links The information, which is understood by machines and not limited to humans only, is able to book tickets online, use dictionaries on the web, or other things that originally require human use to complete.</p>

<li>Representation of knowledge</li>

<p>The representation of knowledge is the field of artificial intelligence that is concerned with enabling machines to think and make decisions, as this knowledge acquired by the machine is collected and 

	stored in a database used to share and manage knowledge, and is a reference for making any intelligent decisions that may come from the machine.


</p>

<li>logical thinking and probability thinking</li>
<p>Logical thinking in Artificial Intelligence is one of the different forms of thinking, as facts are inferred from available data. Logical thinking is countered by what is known as probability                   

thinking, which takes the concept of probability and uncertainty from knowledge, in order to deal with all uncertain future circumstances, which are likely to be questionable.
